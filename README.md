# G3N-Mesh-Tutorial
 This is a basic tutorial which shows you how to create a mesh in G3N from scratch using only a .png texture.

 This tutorial was built on how I learned LWJGL3 from this tutorial: https://lwjglgamedev.gitbooks.io/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/content/

 If you see any ways to improve this tutorial, please let me know.

 If you are brand new to Go I recommend: [Tech With Tim Golang Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-mtY_SE3HuzQJzuj4VlUG0q)

Let's get started.

First of all, this is how this tutorial looks when you run:

    $ go build && ./G3N-Mesh-Tutorial

On Linux or

    $ go build; .\G3N-Mesh-Tutorial.exe

On Windows.
